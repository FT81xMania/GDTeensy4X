# MexSpa Team contribution for [FT81xMania](https://ft81xmania.com/comunidad/)

# GD23ZUTX Library
Library for Teensy 3.5/6, Teensy 4, STM32F1x, STM32F4x, and STM32F7x; based on Gameduino 3 library. For Teensy 3.6/3.6 or 4, this library can use the resources of the SdFat beta 2 of Greiman in order to manage media files like assets, cells, avi, png, jpeg or jpg files from the SDIO reader. Situable for **for FTDI EVE2 or EVE3 chips like FT810, FT811, FT813 or BT815.

# History
We are an enthusiastic team of screens based on [FTDI chip](http://www.ftdichip.com/EVE.htm). We like programming and share our advances. We have reached this goal, our only interest is to give the opportunity to operate this library to multiple platforms of MCU's in the market. Wait for you to enjoy the codes, of our, your time.
Two friends, in Mexico and another in Spain, the water or the puddle does not scare us ...
Last month of May, a member of the Team, we left. We move on.
Without any interest, we publish this library altruistically.

# December 4, 2019: Update. Add support for Teensy 4 (GD23ZUTX)
# June 7, 2018: Release initial (GD23ZU)

1. Library based on [James Bowman](https://github.com/jamesbowman/gd2-lib)
2. Library based on [lightcalamar GD23STM32_F103x](https://github.com/lightcalamar/GD23STM32_F103x) > programmed and modified by [@TFTLCDCyg](https://ft81xmania.com/comunidad/Usuario-tftlcdcyg)
3. Library based on [STM32_GD2](https://github.com/nopnop2002/STM32_GD2) user **@nopnop2002** this [link](http://stm32duino.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=3466#p44477)

Library with function special **playback videos** on MCU's ***STM32F103x***, ***STM32F407x***, ***Nucleo-STM32F767ZI*** and ***Teensy 3.5/6***. This library is compatible with the STM32 families described above. For any other MCU's you can use Unified Library [GD23Z](https://github.com/lightcalamar/GD23Z). All commands are equal to library genuine from James Bowman Gameduino 2/3 last release.
