# MexSpa Team contribution for [FT81xMania](https://ft81xmania.com/comunidad/)

# GDTeensy4X Library
Library only for Teensy 3.5/6, Teensy 4 and Teensy 4.1; based on Gameduino 23X library. This library can use the resources of the SdFat beta 2 of Greiman in order to manage media files like assets, cells, avi, png, jpeg, jpg or avi files from the SDIO reader. Situable for **for FTDI EVE2 or EVE3 chips like FT810, FT811, FT813 or BT815.

# History
We are an enthusiastic team of screens based on [FTDI chip](http://www.ftdichip.com/EVE.htm). We like programming and share our advances. We have reached this goal, our only interest is to give the opportunity to operate this library to multiple platforms of MCU's in the market. Wait for you to enjoy the codes, of our, your time.
Two friends, in Mexico and another in Spain, the water or the puddle does not scare us ...
Last month of May, a member of the Team, we left. We move on.
Without any interest, we publish this library altruistically.
